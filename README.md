# DummyWeather
Just a dummy python REST interface to play with Docker Containers.

Implemented with Python and Flask and do "nothing": simulates weather forecast just with random values.

It provides a very simple webpage to interact with the API Rest:

```
\               *Hello world  Message*
\predict        *Random prediction*

```

and it provides random predictions.

Just to play.
